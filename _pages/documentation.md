            ### Embedded documentation

            Each instance of LAVA comes with the documentation embedded.
            You can read the documentation in the [demo LAVA instance](https://master.lavasoftware.org/static/docs/v2/index.html).

            ### Work in progress

            We are currently reorganizing and rewriting the documentation from scratch to better address comments received from the community.
            This documentation is available at [read the docs](https://lava.readthedocs.io/).
