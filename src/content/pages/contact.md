            ### Mailing-lists

            The best way to get in touch with the community and the LAVA developers is via [mailing-lists](https://lists.lavasoftware.org/).

            ### lava-announce


            Subscribing to the **lava-announce** list is recommended for everyone using LAVA, whether writing tests or viewing
            reports or administering a LAVA instance.
            The release notes for each production release are sent to the **lava-announce** mailing list.
            Replies to this list are sent to the **lava-users** list.

            [Mailing list link](mailto:lava-announce@lists.lavasoftware.org)

            ### lava-devel


            Subscribing to the **lava-devel** list is recommended for developers of LAVA.

            **lava-devel** is aimed at supporting code contributors, device integration engineers and instance admins who are work-
            ing with the LAVA codebase. Discussions about planning and new LAVA features also take place here.

            ### lava-users


            The **lava-users** mailing list concentrates on support for setting up and using LAVA.

            ### IRC

            IRC is a common support method for developers. Our team is spread geographically around the world, with members
            in Europe, America and Asia.

            The LAVA Software Community Project has an IRC channel, `#lavasoftware` on [irc.libera.net](https://web.libera.chat/).

            We can also be found on a IRC channel used for topics relating to the Linaro Lab in Cambridge, UK: `#linaro-lava` on
